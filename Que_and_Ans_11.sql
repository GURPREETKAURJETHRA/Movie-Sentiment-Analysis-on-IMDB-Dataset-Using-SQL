/* So, the minimum and maximum values in each column of the ratings table are in the expected range. 

This implies there are no outliers in the table. 
Now, letâ€™s find out the top 10 movies based on average rating.*/

-- Q11. Which are the top 10 movies based on average rating?

-- For that we will use here RANK() or DENSE_RANK()

-- Finding the rank of each movie based on it's average rating
-- Displaying the top 10 movies using LIMIT clause

SELECT     
   title,
   avg_rating,
   Rank() OVER(ORDER BY avg_rating DESC) AS movie_rank
FROM       ratings AS rat
INNER JOIN movie   AS mov
ON         mov.id = rat.movie_id limit 10;
